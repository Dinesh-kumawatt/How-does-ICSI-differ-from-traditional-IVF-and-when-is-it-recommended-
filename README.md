# How-does-ICSI-differ-from-traditional-IVF-and-when-is-it-recommended-

ICSI and IVF are both fertility treatments that help couples have a baby, but the main difference is how the sperm meets the egg.

In traditional IVF, the doctor collects eggs from the woman and mixes them with sperm in a lab dish. Then, nature takes over. The sperm swim to the egg, and hopefully, one fertilizes it on its own. This works well if the sperm count is normal and the sperm can move properly.

But in some cases, the sperm is too weak, too few, or can't swim right. That’s where ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) comes in. In ICSI, the embryologist picks a single best sperm and injects it directly into the egg using a very thin needle. It’s more controlled, and it helps fertilization happen even if the sperm has problems.

ICSI is usually recommended for:

Male infertility – low sperm count, poor motility, or abnormal shape

Previous failed IVF cycles

Frozen sperm or sperm taken from testicular tissue (like TESA/PESA)

Unexplained infertility when no clear cause is found

Fertilization issues in past attempts

Now, ICSI is used in many IVF cases because it increases the chances of fertilization. But it doesn’t always mean it’s better for everyone. If the sperm is healthy, regular IVF may work just fine. Doctors usually decide after looking at both partners’ test reports.

Many couples think that once fertilization is done with ICSI, pregnancy is confirmed. But that’s not the case. ICSI helps make embryos, but after that, it still depends on how well the embryo grows and if it implants in the uterus.

The good part is ICSI has a good track record. It helps in almost 70–80% of male infertility cases. It’s also safe, and many healthy babies have been born using this technique. The embryos formed through ICSI are just like those from IVF.

Also, ICSI does not increase the risk of birth defects compared to IVF. That was a worry many years ago, but now, with better labs and follow-ups, doctors say it's as safe as regular IVF.
